Hi everyone, my name is Milan, and today I’m presenting my full-stack project called Pro-Tasker.
This is a task and project management application built using React, TypeScript, Tailwind, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

1. What the project does?

Pro-Tasker allows users to register, verify their account, log in, and manage their own projects and tasks.
A verified user can create, update, and delete projects, and each project can have multiple tasks connected to it.

2. Why I built it?

While building this project, I wanted to improve my skills in connecting a React frontend with a Node and Express backend.
I faced real challenges like Axios errors, deployment failures, and TypeScript issues—so this app helped me learn full-stack debugging and real-world coding problems.

3. How it works?

Once the user logs in, they can see all their projects.
They can create new projects, update the project details, and delete them if needed.
Inside each project, they can also add tasks, update task status, and remove tasks.
The entire app is secure, and users can only modify their own content.

4. Tech Stack?

The frontend is built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind, and Axios for API calls.
The backend uses Node.js, Express, MongoDB, JWT authentication, and bcrypt for password hashing.
The two communicate through REST APIs

5. Challenges:
The biggest challenges were:

- Connecting frontend & backend
- Fixing Axios CORS issues
- Solving TypeScript errors
- Deploying on Netlify & Render
  Working through these taught me how to troubleshoot errors and understand how full-stack applications work behind the scenes.

6. Conclusion

Pro-Tasker helped me gain confidence as a full-stack developer because I built everything—from database models, APIs, authentication, to the frontend UI and TypeScript types.

Thank you for being a part.
